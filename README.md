## 🛠️ What This Is

This repo documents how I modified **Hungry Hungry Hippos** for a child with physical limitations. It’s not a formal tutorial, but I’ve shared:

- My process
- Circuit diagrams
- Parts list
- Source code
- Printable hardware

The goal is to help others learn from it, adapt it, or remix it for their own accessible game projects.
